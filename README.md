# Stock_Prediction_LSTM
Predicting stock prices for every Monday of each week using stock data from Monday to Friday in Amazon and Cisco companies. The LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory) algorithm is employed for this stock price prediction task. Each dataset presents its own unique challenges, such as incomplete data between Mondays and Fridays every week or the absence of data for the Monday to be predicted. Consequently, before implementing the LSTM algorithm, several data preprocessing steps are necessary to address these data issues. This includes data division into training, testing, and validation datasets.

After conducting stock price predictions with the LSTM algorithm, a hyperparameter tuning process is also performed using a custom-built GridSearch function. This involves searching for the optimal hyperparameters, such as batch size, number of epochs, units, optimizer, and activation function, aimed at minimizing error metrics like RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, which serve as evaluation metrics for the model. It has been demonstrated that the model using the tuned hyperparameters produces smaller RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values for both datasets compared to the model with untuned parameters.
